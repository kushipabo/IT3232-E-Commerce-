This repository contains various Java programming tasks demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, including loops, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data structures.

1. Print a Message
A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. Print Numbers from 1 to 10
Using a loop to print numbers sequentially from 1 to 10.

3. Print Numbers in Reverse

6. Student Class with Average Marks Calculation
- Defines a `Student` class with attributes for name and marks.
- Stores multiple student objects in a collection.
- Calculates and displays the average marks of all students.

7. Library System Using OOP Principles
- Implements an abstract `Book` class with subclasses `PrintedBook`, `EBook`, and `AudioBook`.
- Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- A `Library` class creates and manages books.
